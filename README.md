Programming is a lot more interesting than writing code that computers can run.
However, that aspect is the first one people will encounter, and in many cases
it may discourage them from looking further.

We will try to explore some of the common problems and solutions that people
may run into in different systems, and how they are actually similar to the
problems that software deals with.

Many software developers are so used to these concepts that they will
instinctively see them in the wild. They may find it useful to have a glossary
with examples to share with other people.
