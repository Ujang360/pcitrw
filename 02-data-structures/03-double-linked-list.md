## Double Linked List

### Example

#### Grocery List

This time, to make a grocery list we are going to write each item we want to
buy in a post-it. We can now attach any item we want to add to the list on any
position, which will help us to keep the list sorted in a convenient way.

We can also iterate the list from top to bottom or from bottom to top.
