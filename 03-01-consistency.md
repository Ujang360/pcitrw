### Consistency

#### Example

##### Civil Registry

A civil registry keeps records of people's personal information like births,
marriages and deaths.

For a Civil Registry to be a consistent database, we need to make sure
of the following:

* Information  written is always correct. For example, nobody can die more
than once, and only people who was born can get married.

* Anything written will be saved and available when reading afterwards.
No sheet can be lost or forgotten.

We can say instead it is eventually consistent if the written report does not
need to be available right away. For example, if we have different offices
receiving information, a birth that is written in one may not be
known in the other office until they share records at some future time.
