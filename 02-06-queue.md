### Queue

#### Example

##### Cashier lines

A small market has a cashier. When people want to buy things, they form a line
and pay one at a time. This line is a queue.

A supermarket may have many cashiers, and each can have its own line. Each
of these acts on its own.

If instead we form a single line that is shared by all cashiers, we will have a
single line, and each of the cashiers would take the next one, in the same
order they were ready.

#### Definition

A queue is a list where things are taken out in the same order they were
added.
