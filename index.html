<p>There are many aspects to programming that are needed to write code. In this
book we will focus only on some basic concepts that can be explained in
isolation, and may be interesting for non programmers.</p>

<p>The goal is not to teach how to program, but to show what programming is about.
What are some of the topics software engineer discuss, and which tools they
use to solve problems.</p>

<h2>Algorithms</h2>

<h3>Binary Search</h3>

<h4>Example</h4>

<h5>Dictionary</h5>

<p>A person wants to look for a word in an English dictionary.
They may open the book in any page, choose any word in it and compare it
with the word they are looking for. Since the words are sorted they know in
which way to proceed. They can now do this process over and over again
until finding the wanted word.</p>

<p>Doing these steps will lead to the result sooner or later. But if
instead of comparing any word, they compare with the word that is
exactly in the middle of the acceptable range, the number of required
comparisons is as low as it can be.</p>

<p><img src="01-01-binary-search.horse.png" alt="" title="" /></p>

<h4>Guess Who?</h4>

<p>The same idea can be applied to the children's game Guess Who?. The
best strategy is to ask a question that will drop half of the
possibilities.</p>

<p>On the other hand, asking a very specific question, it is very likely to get
little information in most cases, and a lot in a few.</p>

<h4>Properties</h4>

<p>Binary Search is a list of steps that we can do to find a result in a
collection. It is called "binary" because after each step, we should be able to
keep only about half of the items in the collection.</p>

<p>In general, it is used on a list of sorted items, like words or numbers.
But the same idea can be used any time we want to localize something, and we
can reduce half of the possible results at a time.</p>

<p>Since half of the possibilities are dropped after each comparison, it is
pretty fast to find what we are looking for in not so many steps. For a million
items, we can localize any one in up to twenty comparisons. And for a
thousand millions, up to 30.</p>

<h3>Map/Reduce</h3>

<h4>Example</h4>

<h5>Elections</h5>

<p>When a small group of people want to have an election where the vote is secret,
each will write down their desired output, gather all together, shuffle and
count the matching results.</p>

<p>This however does not work well for large groups of peopl, sinve it will take a
long time to cast all votes and count them. Luckily, this is a problem that has
already been solved by modern democratic states: they divide the people in
groups, each group will cast their votes, a group member will count the results
and summarize them in a single sheet of paper. All those sheets of paper are
then submitted to a central person who adds up the votes to find the winner.</p>

<p>The act of counting each individual vote and write down a summary is called
"map", while making an overall summary of all summaries is called "reduce".</p>

<p><img src="01-02-map-reduce.elections.png" alt="" title="" /></p>

<h4>Properties</h4>

<p>The benefit of map/reduce is to divide a big problem into smaller ones that can
be executed at the same time, and then the results combined.</p>

<h3>Asymmetric Encryption</h3>

<h4>Example</h4>

<h5>Coffers and keys</h5>

<p>Before the telegraph was created, the only way to transmit a message was to
send an object with the message. The question is how to make sure nobody except
the recipient reads the message. If the sender can agree with them in advance,
they can give them a key to a coffer, and then send a message inside the
coffer. We will assume the coffer cannot be opened without the key.</p>

<p>Now there is a post office that keeps open coffers whose keys belong to anyone
interested in receiving messages. When a person wants to send a private
message, they will ask the post office for a coffer. Now they will include
their message in that coffer, and another open coffer inside of it, to which
they own the key. The recipient can then reply privately using this second
coffer.</p>

<h4>Properties</h4>

<p>With this system, anyone can establish a secure connection with anyone
registered in the post office, or if they can somehow make a secure connection
once, temporarily.</p>

<h2>Data Structures</h2>

<h3>Array</h3>

<h4>Example</h4>

<h5>Grocery List</h5>

<p>To make a grocery list you grab a sheet of paper and start writing from top to
bottom what you need to buy. This is the simplest way of making a list.</p>

<p><img src="02-01-array.grocery.png" alt="" title="" /></p>

<h4>Properties</h4>

<p>Adding items to an array at the end is easy. And adding more capacity
(including a second sheet of paper) is also possible.</p>

<p>It is not easy to add things in the middle of the list. It requires you to
copy every item one line below to have the free space where you want the
insertion.</p>

<h3>Linked List</h3>

<h4>Example</h4>

<h5>Field trip</h5>

<p>In a school field trip, stand all children in a line and ask them to remember
who is to their right. Now, you remember who is in each of the edges.</p>

<p>Now at any point, you can ask the first child to point to the second, and then
ask the second for the third, and so on. If you reach the last child then you
are sure that your list is complete.</p>

<p><img src="02-02-linked-list.field-trip.png" alt="" title="" /></p>

<h4>Properties</h4>

<p>In this schema, it is easy to add something at any point in the list. If the
list is sorted by some criteria, you can find where the insertion needs to
happen and just ask the previous node to point to the new value and the
new value to what the node was pointing at.</p>

<p>It is hard, though, to identify a node by its position. If you want to know
the position of a node, you have to start from the first and count until you
reach it.</p>

<h3>Double Linked List</h3>

<h4>Example</h4>

<h5>Grocery List</h5>

<p>This time, to make a grocery list we are going to write each item we want to
buy in a post-it. We can now attach any item we want to add to the list on any
position, which will help us to keep the list sorted in a convenient way.</p>

<p>We can also iterate the list from top to bottom or from bottom to top.</p>

<p><img src="02-03-double-linked-list.grocery.png" alt="" title="" /></p>

<h5>Field trip</h5>

<p>In a school field trip, stand all children in a line and ask them to remember
who is to their right and to their left. Now, you remember who is in each of
the edges.</p>

<p>Now at any point, you can ask both of the edges to point to the next node, and
continue until both iterations reach the same node.</p>

<p><img src="02-03-double-linked-list.field-trip.png" alt="" title="" /></p>

<h4>Properties</h4>

<p>Like in the linked list case, we can easily insert nodes anywhere in the list,
but now we can iterate the nodes from either of the edges, but we are asking
each node to remember more.</p>

<h3>Hash Map</h3>

<h4>Example</h4>

<h5>Closet</h5>

<p>When organizing a closet, people usually group clothing by type. You'll see a
pile with t-shirts, a pile with pants, a socks drawer, etc. And now, whenever
you want to grab something, you go to the bucket that should contain it, see
all of the items in there and pick the right one.</p>

<p>Now, if we wanted to, we could add more granularity to the categories. Instead
of having a socks drawer we can have a green socks drawer, another for red
socks, another for white socks, and so on. As long as we know in which drawer
the sock we are looking for is, we can look it up faster, since we will have
less incorrect items in the drawer.</p>

<h4>Properties</h4>

<p>If we have enough buckets, we can add and look up any item really fast.</p>

<h3>Btree</h3>

<h4>Example</h4>

<h5>Dictionary</h5>

<p>Let's grab a dictionary, and insert in the first page an index that associates
each letter with the page that letter's first word is. Now, at the begin of
each letter, we can create another index for the combination of that letter and
the next one in the word, and so on.</p>

<p>Now we can find out each word by following the index letter by letter, without
any search.</p>

<p><img src="02-05-btree.dictionary.png" alt="" title="" /></p>

<h4>Properties</h4>

<p>A Btree allows you to have a hierarchy of index to follow to get the element
you are looking for. The number of indices to follow grows with the number of
elements, but at a much slower rate.</p>

<h2>Databases</h2>

<h3>Consistency</h3>

<h4>Example</h4>

<h5>Civil Registry</h5>

<p>A civil registry keeps records of citizen's vital events like births, marriages
and deaths.</p>

<p>To define the Civil Registry as a consistent database, we need to make sure
of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Data inserted is always valid. For example, nobody can die more than once,
and only people who was born can get married.</p></li>
<li><p>Any data that is written, will be stored and available when reading
afterwards. No sheet can be lost or ignored.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We can say instead it is eventually consistent if we loosen the immediacy of
the availability of written data. For example, if we have different offices
where the events can be registered, a birth that is written in one may not be
known in the other office until they eventually sync up. This must happen at
some point, but its frequency can be arbitrarily set.</p>

<h3>Atomicity and Isolation</h3>

<h4>Example</h4>

<h5>Bank Transfer</h5>

<p>If a bank cashier wants to transfer money between two accounts, there are
actually two operations: subtract the amount from one of the accounts and
add it to the other one.</p>

<p>For these operations to be considered atomic, they need to happen both or
neither. If money is added to one of the accounts, but the subtraction of the
other one fails (for lack of funds, for example) the addition needs to be
canceled.</p>

<p>For them to be considered isolated, nobody else should be able to check out the
balances of the accounts during the operations with one of them executed
and the other one not. Results must be available altogether.</p>

<h3>SQL Injection</h3>

<h4>Example</h4>

<h5>Who's on First?</h5>

<p>From Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTcRRaXV-fg">"Who's on first?"</a> is a comedy
routine made famous by Abbott and Costello. The premise of the sketch is that
Abbott is identifying the players on a baseball team for Costello, but their
names and nicknames can be interpreted as non-responsive answers to
Costello's questions. For example, the first baseman is named "Who"; thus,
the utterance "Who's on first" is ambiguous between the question ("Which
person is the first baseman?") and the answer ("The name of the first
baseman is 'Who'").</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Explanation</h4>

<p>A SQL injection works by confusing the command that needs to be performed by
introducing ambiguous terms modifying the grammar of the statement.</p>

<h3>CAP Theorem</h3>

<h4>Example</h4>

<h5>Civil Registry</h5>

<p>Supose a Civil Registry with five offices and phone lines between them.
There are different ways of organizing. We are going to analyze two extremes.</p>

<h6># Highly available (AP)</h6>

<p>Each of the offices can take new data from people and at the end of the day,
they will share the information they received with all the other offices.</p>

<p>This could be a problem since it may allow invalid data, for example if a
person is registered as dead in one office and the married in another one.
If there was a single office, this would never happen since that person's
registry will be kept up to date, but now we are allowing up to one day of
stale information.</p>

<p>Other possible problem is what happens if one office suffers an accident or a
natural disaster and some of its data from the day is lost. People who already
left the office do not know the Registry lost it and will run into a problem
in the future.</p>

<h6>Highly consistent (CP)</h6>

<p>In this other approach, any data change needs to be coordinated by all the
offices. This way, all the data is always valid, available in every office,
and no single one is responsible for its durability.</p>

<p>Problems may appear when the phone network becomes unreliable. If a single
office phone is broken, all offices will stop working.</p>

<h5>Properties</h5>

<p>It is said that a distributed database can only be highly available or highly
consistent. Different balances between both can be achieved, as a compromise,
for different use cases.</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>

<h3>TCP vs UDP</h3>

<h4>Example</h4>

<h5>Walkie Talkie</h5>

<p>Two kids got a pair of Walkie Talkie, a handheld two-way radio. They are
playing outside, in a large area. They soon realize sometimes the messages
do not go through, but they keep playing and enjoying when they work.</p>

<h5>Airplanes</h5>

<p>A similar technology is used to communicate between airplains and the control
tower. However, in this case, the reliability is really important, so there are
strict protocols in place. When a command is given from the control tower,
the airplane must not only acknowledge but repeat the message to make sure it
was properly received.</p>

<h4>Properties</h4>

<p>Both TCP and UDP allow to communicate data, but the former allows the sender to
know that the data was sent completely and correctly.</p>

<h3>Encoding</h3>

<h4>Example</h4>

<h5>Finger counting</h5>

<p>When people learn to count, they intuitively use their hand. Each finger that
is lifted counts as one, then lifting three fingers represent the number three.</p>

<p>If we want to count to larger numbers we will run out of fingers when we reach
ten. But we can assign different values to each one and the count to over one
thousand.</p>

<p>For example, in our left hand the thumb can be worth one, the index finger
can be two, the middle one four, the ring one eight and the pinky sixteen.</p>

<p>Now if we want to represent the number fourteen, we can lift the our three
middle fingers.</p>

<h4>Properties</h4>

<p>To successfully encode and decode a value, it is necessary to agree on a
representation. And the sender needs to know how to create this representation
for any value, while the receiver needs to know how to read it to get the
value.</p>
