### Double Linked List

#### Example

##### Grocery List

This time, to make a grocery list we are going to write each item we want to
buy in a post-it. We can now attach any item we want to add to the list on any
position, which will help us to keep the list sorted in a convenient way.

We can also iterate the list from top to bottom or from bottom to top.

##### Field trip

In a school field trip, stand all children in a line and ask them to remember
who is to their right and to their left. Now, you remember who is in each of
the edges.

Now at any point, you can ask both of the edges to point to the next node, and
continue until both iterations reach the same node.

#### Properties

Like in the linked list case, we can easily insert nodes anywhere in the list,
but now we can iterate the nodes from either of the edges, but we are asking
each node to remember more.
