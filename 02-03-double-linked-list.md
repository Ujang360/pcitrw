### Double Linked List

#### Example

##### Grocery List

This time, to make a list to go to the market we are going to write each item
we want to
buy in a post-it. We can now stick any item we want to add to the list on any
position, which will help us to keep the list sorted in a useful way.

We can also walk the list from top to bottom or from bottom to top.

##### Field trip

In a school field trip, stand all children in a line and ask them to remember
who is to their right and to their left. Now, you remember who is in each of
the sides.

Now at any point, you can ask both of the sides to point to the next child, and
continue until the same child was pointed to by both lists.

#### Definition

A double linked list is yet another way of representing a list of things.
Like in the linked list case, we can easily add items anywhere in the list,
but now we can walk the items from either of the sides, but we are asking
each item to remember more.
