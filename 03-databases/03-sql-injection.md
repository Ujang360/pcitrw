### SQL Injection

#### Example

##### Who's on First?

From Wikipedia:

> ["Who's on first?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTcRRaXV-fg) is a comedy
> routine made famous by Abbott and Costello. The premise of the sketch is that
> Abbott is identifying the players on a baseball team for Costello, but their
> names and nicknames can be interpreted as non-responsive answers to
> Costello's questions. For example, the first baseman is named "Who"; thus,
> the utterance "Who's on first" is ambiguous between the question ("Which
> person is the first baseman?") and the answer ("The name of the first
> baseman is 'Who'").

#### Explanation

A SQL injection works by confusing the command that needs to be performed by
introducing ambiguous terms modifying the grammar of the statement.
