### Array

#### Example

##### Grocery List

To make a grocery list you grab a sheet of paper and start writing from top to
bottom what you need to buy. This is the simplest way of making a list.

#### Properties

Adding items to an array at the end is easy. And adding more capacity
(including a second sheet of paper) is also possible.

It is not easy to add things in the middle of the list. It requires you to
copy every item one line below to have the free space where you want the
insertion.
