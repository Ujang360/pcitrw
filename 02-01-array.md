### Array

#### Example

##### Grocery List

To make a list to go to the market, people take a sheet of paper and start
writing from top to bottom what you need to buy. This is the simplest way of
making a list.

#### Properties

Adding items to an array at the end is easy. And adding more space
(including a second sheet of paper) is also possible.

It is not easy to add things in the middle of the list. It requires you to
copy every item one line under each of them to have the free space where you
want the new item.
