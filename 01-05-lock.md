### Lock

#### Example

##### Bathroom key

There is a public bathroom that anyone who wants to use it can. However, when
someone is inside, no one else should use it. There is a single key to open its
door, and the holder is the only person who can use it.

##### Stoplight

When two streets cross, there might be a stoplight in the corner to organize
who can go at any time.

#### Definition

A lock limits who can use a public resource, in order to stop many people
running into each other when trying to use it.
