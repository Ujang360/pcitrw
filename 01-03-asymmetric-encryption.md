### Asymmetric Encryption

#### Example

##### Coffers and keys

Before the telegraph was created, the only way to contact someone was to
send a thing with a letter. The question is how to make sure nobody except
the recipient reads it. If the sender can agree with them earlier,
they can give them a key to a coffer, and then send a letter inside it.
We will assume the coffer cannot be opened without the key.

Now there is a post office that keeps open coffers and the key of each is in
the hands of the people interested in receiving letters.  When a person wants
to send a private letter, they will ask the post office for a coffer.
Now they will include their letter in that coffer, and another open coffer
inside of it, to which they own the key. The recipient can then answer
privately using this second coffer.

#### Properties

With this system, anyone can send letters privately to anyone that has a coffer
in the post office, or if they can somehow receive a coffer once.
