### TCP vs UDP

#### Example

##### Walkie Talkie

Two kids got a pair of Walkie Talkie, a handheld two-way radio. They are
playing outside, in a large area. They soon realize sometimes the messages
do not go through, but they keep playing and enjoying when they work.

##### Airplanes

A similar technology is used to communicate between airplains and the control
tower. However, in this case, the reliability is really important, so there are
strict protocols in place. When a command is given from the control tower,
the airplane must not only acknowledge but repeat the message to make sure it
was properly received.

#### Properties

Both TCP and UDP allow to communicate data, but the former allows the sender to
know that the data was sent completely and correctly.
