### TCP vs UDP

#### Example

##### Walkie Talkie

Two kids got a pair of Walkie Talkies, a small two-way radio. They are
playing outside, in a large area. They soon realize sometimes the sound is
not good, but they keep playing and enjoying when they work.

##### Airplanes

Airport's control tower use a similar system to talk to airplanes. However,
in this case, receiving the right information is really important, so there are
agreements in place to get rid of these problems. When an order is given from
the control tower, the airplane must not only say they have received it, but
also say it back to make sure it was correctly received.

#### Definition

Both TCP and UDP allow two parties to talk to each other, but TCP allows the
sender to know that the information was sent completely and correctly.
